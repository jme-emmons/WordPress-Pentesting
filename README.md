# WordPress-Pentesting

Exploit 1

   I put a script in the comments on the http://wpdistillery.vm/.
    This is a cross site scripting vunerability.
    WordPress 3.7-4.4
    source code: https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/8358

Exploit 2

    I put a script in the title of a page.
    This is a cross site scripting vunerability.
    WordPress <= 4.2
     <img src="attack_2.gif" width="800"> 

Did not get an exploit 3 to work in a reasonable amount of time.
